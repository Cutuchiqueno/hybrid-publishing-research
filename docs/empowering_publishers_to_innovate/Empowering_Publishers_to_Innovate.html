<h1>Empowering Publishers to Innovate</h1>
<p>Presentation - Simon Worthington, Post Digital Scholar Conference, Lüneburg 2014</p>
<h1></a>The Consortium</h1>
<p>The Consortium develops Open Source software for public infrastructures for publishing, covering key parts of the publishing workflow–lowering cost, speeding up production cycles and introducing new forms of publishing. We support software producers to innovate existing Open Source platforms. We also want to innovate the digital book and reading experience. Now that there are floods of Open Access content for the user to sort through, the book must evolve to take on fresh interface design challenges, as the tech industry is only delivering a poor imitation of the paper book. Core to what we do is open research–methods and design research processes–which we see as being as important as the software we produce.</p>
<h1></a>The problems we are addressing</h1>
<p>Our aim is to address the problems of small cultural publishers, across; art, design, museums, archives and Digital Humanities.</p>
<h2></a>What are these problems:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>They cannot access publics on mobile and tablets. Especially in the MLA sector where an endless stream of great museum publication stay in limited print runs with poor distribution.</li>
  <li>Lastly publishers cannot afford to innovate, and if they do it's hard to scale, or distribute the technology.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Press</h3>
<p>At the core of the Consortium we have made a Open Source <b>digital press</b>, called TypeSetr, that accepts DOCX, HTML, Gdoc as inputs and automatically applies templated design layouts for EPUB, responsive HTML, PDF, POD and more. The press is 'single source' based, meaning if you make edits to one document, they can be updated across all formats. The press generates a structured document, which is machine readable. This is firstly for automated multi-format layout designs and second for Dynamic Publishing applying algorithmic and other document reuse.</p>
<h3>A-machine</h3>
<p>A-machine is our <b>phase II software project</b>. A-machine uses the structured document from the digital press to allow further semi-automation of the workflow known as Dynamic Publishing, this covers things like–distribution, translation management, payment, citation extraction etc. A-machine is an ecosystem of software, connecting existing Open Source platforms, such as–Zotero, Transpect from the company le-tex and Tamboti from the Heidelberg Research Architecture to support a wide variety of workflows.</p>
<p><b>Book to the Future</b></p>
<p>Our focus in on the near horizon of 'Post-Open Access Publishing', and how to enhance the book form in an open IPR context. Our lens on publishing is the publication lifecycle and workflow, and by studying these we gain insights to drive innovation. An example 'future book' scenario is to have all references available inline, and in full. The history of the future book can be framed as the 'Unbound Book', exemplified by the work of technologists like Alan Kay of Dynabook, Ted Nelson inventor of Xanadu, as well as in publishing histories like Markus Krajewski's book, Paper Machines.</p>
<h3>Publishing Prototypes</h3>
<p>The Hybrid Publishing Consortium has four publication prototypes;</p>
<ul>
  <li>First is with Fotomuseum Winterthur, and the publication<i> Manifeste!</i> Where we examine how the high quality museum catalog can be digitised and taken to open learning contexts.</li>
  <li>Second is the McLuhan archive, where we create transmedia trace of a users journey through the archive, using Heidelberg Universities Tamboti platform and the platform Pandora - creating commentaries or glosses as publications.</li>
  <li>Third is Moos Verlag, where we look to engage a new community with a 1970s urbanism publishing collection, this involves book scanning and re-publishing titles free online.</li>
  <li>Last is Merve Verlag, where we are digitising 100 books from their back catalogue and will be making it available for remixing. The project was launched at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October at merve.consortium.io and will be developed by Merve as a free-2-air book remixing platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, any questions.</p>
