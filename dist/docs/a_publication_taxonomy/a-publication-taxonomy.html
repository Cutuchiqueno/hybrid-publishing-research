            <section>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dear Community,</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Publication Taxonomy, an exploratory listing project by the Hybrid Publishing Consortium.</p>
            <p>The Hybrid Publishing Consortium is the technology research arm of the Hybrid Publishing Lab and is made up of a team of six interdisciplinary researchers, developing open source software for multi-format publishing. Creating an exploratory taxonomy of publication types plays a role in our software design process helping us understand the boundaries of publishing forms.</p>
            <p>When the Consortium started to compile a list of the various types of scholarly publications we had to keep in mind the challenge of a continuously changing technology landscape. This meant moving to a so called post-digital condition (although a contested term)–involving parallel usage of various media types, a new collaborative paradigm, a proliferation of tool sets and open access academic publishing.</p>
            <p>To give some limits around what we define as a publication we agreed on three very open parameters–(1) the act of making a document public, (2) the involvement of textuality, and (3) a scholarly/academic orientation.</p>
            <p>Acceleration best describes the overall condition for both the development of publishing and the shaping of the emergent post-digital scholar, blurring the distinction between the publishers workflow and the scholars textual creation. The renegotiation of new roles for publisher and scholar is one area where new publishing types emerge, especially where the act of reading becomes a new textual creation. An instability arises in the scholarly workflow and how the scholar is organizing and adjusting her/his work steps within the post-digital condition. It also means an expansion of the very definition what constitutes a publication.</p>
            <p>To add to the post-digital scholars’ palette of opportunities we introduce dynamic publishing, an industry term to describe digital automated processes in publishing–distribution, rights management and reading analytics–to name a few areas.</p>
            <p>Below you’ll find a list compiled of various publication types that can currently be found on the publishing horizon. We tried to sort these established &amp; emerging types and find a common definition for each. We did this to gain an overview of the forms available and the purposes they serve. We were and are looking at classic forms of publishing as well as hybrid forms, expanding to publications with enhanced options of interaction and engagement, investigating the potential of modularity, intermixing printed matter and digital media.</p>
            <p>We came up with a list, parted into two sections:</p>
            <p>PART 1 - conventional academic publications</p>
            <p>PART 2 - unconventional, experimental types, appearing within and outside of academia.</p>
            <p>The second part is to create a pool of possible directions for the publishing domain. As you can see this list not comprehensive. Therefore please feel invited to share your comments and types of publications you think relevant to include. For a better understanding of the options we'd greatly appreciate if you added an example, in form of a link or description.</p>

                    <h4>Academic Book Review</h4>
                    <p>Book reviews of scholarly books are checks upon the research books published by scholars; unlike articles, book reviews tend to be solicited. Journals typically have a separate book review editor determining which new books to review and by whom. If an outside scholar accepts the book review editor’s request for a book review, he or she generally receives a free copy of the book from the journal in exchange for a timely review. Publishers send books to book review editors in the hope that their books will be reviewed. The length and depth of research book reviews varies much from journal to journal, as does the extent of textbook and trade book review. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal#Book_reviews">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal#Book_reviews</a>

                    <h4>Academic Journal</h4>
                    <p>A peer-reviewed periodical in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as forums for the introduction and presentation for scrutiny of new research, and the critique of existing research. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews.</p>

                    <p>—Data journal (focus on interaction and reuse, traceable)</p>
                    <p>peer reviewed data papers describing datasets with high reuse potential. Associated data is to be professionally archived, preserved, and openly available. Equally important, the data and the papers are citable, and reuse will be tracked.

                    <h5>Overlay journal (only online, compiled out of existing material, re-use)</h5>
                    <p>An overlay journal or overlay ejournal is a term for a specific type of open access academic journal, almost always an online electronic journal (ejournal). Such a journal does not produce its own content, but selects from texts that are already freely available online. While many overlay journals derive their content from preprint servers, others, such as the Lund Medical Faculty Monthly, contain mainly papers published by commercial publishers but with links to self archived pre- or post prints when possible.</p>
                    <p>The editors of such a journal locate suitable material from open access repositories and public domain sources, read it, and evaluate its worth. This evaluation may take the form of the judgement of a single editor or editors, or a full peer review process.</p>
                    <p>Public validation of subsequently approved texts may take several forms. At its most formal, the editor may republish the article with explicit approval. Approval might take the form of an addition to the text or its metadata. Or the editor may simply link to the article, via the table of contents of the overlay journal. An alternative approach is to link to articles already published in various open access ejournals, but adding value by grouping scattered articles together as a single themed issue of the overlay journal. Such themed issues allow the focussed coverage of relatively obscure or newly emerging topics.</p>

                    <p>An anthology is a collection of literary works chosen by the compiler. It may be a collection of poems, short stories, plays, songs, or excerpts. In genre fiction anthology is used to categorize collections of shorter works such as short stories and short novels, usually collected into a single volume for publication. The complete collections of works are often called Complete Works or Opera Omnia (Latin language equivalent).</p>

                    <p>The Conference Poster is a central part of a Poster Session or Poster Presentation which is common at scientific congresses or conferences. During a poster session researchers accompany a paper poster (Conference Poster), illustrating their research methods and outcomes. The poster itself varies in size according to conference guidelines from 2x3 feet to 4x8 feet in dimensions (approximately 60x90cm to 120x243cm). Posters are often created using a presentation program such as PowerPoint and may be printed on a large format printer. Posters are often laminated with plastic to improve durability. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session</a> (+ changes)</p>

It may nonetheless be an important source of information for researchers, because it tends to be original and recent. Examples of grey literature include patents, technical reports from government agencies or scientific research groups, working papers from research groups or committees, white papers, and preprints. The term “grey literature” is used in library and information science.</p>

                    <p>A reference work is a book or serial publication to which one can refer for confirmed facts. The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. Indexes are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually. Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs. Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as software packages or online through the Internet.</p>

                    <h5>Encyclopedia (meta, “all human knowledge”)</h5>
                    <p>A type of reference work – a compendium holding a summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge. Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries, which are usually accessed alphabetically by article name. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking, unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information to cover the thing or concept for which the article name stands. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia</a>

                    <h5>Compendium</h5>
                    <p>A concise, yet comprehensive compilation of a body of knowledge. A compendium may summarize a larger work. In most cases the body of knowledge will concern some delimited field of human interest or endeavour, while a “universal” encyclopedia can be referred to as a compendium of all human knowledge. It could also be referred to as a tome. The word compendium arrives from the Latin word “compenso”, meaning “to weigh together or balance”. The 21st century has seen the rise of democratized, online compendia in various fields.</p>

                    <h5>Handbook (more hands on, instructions, guideline)</h5>
                    <p>A handbook is a type of reference work, or other collection of instructions, that is intended to provide ready reference. A handbook is a treatise on a special subject. Nowadays it is often a simple but all-embracing treatment, containing concise information and being small enough to be held in the hand. A handbook is sometimes referred to as a vade mecum (Latin, “go with me”) or pocket reference that is intended to be carried at all times. It may also be referred to as an enchiridion. Handbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of information in a particular field or about a particular technique. They are designed to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. For example, the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers is a reference for how to cite works in MLA style, among other things.</p>

                    <p>Any informational work (usually of writing, speech, television, or film) made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a widely presentable form.</p>
                    <p>Written reports are documents which present focused, salient content to a specific audience. Reports are often used to display the result of an experiment, investigation, or inquiry. The audience may be public or private, an individual or the public in general. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields.</p>
                    <p>Reports use features such as graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade that specific audience to undertake an action. One of the most common formats for presenting reports is IMRAD: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion. This structure is standard for the genre because it mirrors the traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. Reports are not required to follow this pattern, and may use alternative patterns like the problem-solution format.</p>
                    <p>Additional elements often used to persuade readers include: headings to indicate topics, to more complex formats including charts, tables, figures, pictures, tables of contents, abstracts,and nouns summaries, appendices, footnotes, hyperlinks, and references. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report</a>

                    <p>A blog (a truncation of the expression web log)[1] is a discussion or informational site published on the World Wide Web and consisting of discrete entries (“posts”) typically displayed in reverse chronological order (the most recent post appears first). Until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently “multi-author blogs” (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities,think tanks, advocacy groups and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other “microblogging” systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into societal newstreams. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.</p>

                    <p>A book review is a form of literary criticism in which a book is analyzed based on content, style, and merit. A book review can be a primary source opinion piece, summary review or scholarly review. Books can be reviewed for printed periodicals, magazines and newspapers, as school work, or for book web sites on the internet. A book review’s length may vary from a single paragraph to a substantial essay. Such a review may evaluate the book on the basis of personal taste. Reviewers may use the occasion of a book review for a display of learning or to promulgate their own ideas on the topic of a fiction or non-fiction work. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_review">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_review</a>

                    <p>&#8203;1) A small booklet or leaflet containing information about a single subject.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=define+pamphlet&amp;oq=define+pamphlet&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3410j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.de/search?q=define+pamphlet&amp;oq=define+pamphlet&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3410j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>&#8203;2) A pamphlet is an unbound booklet (that is, without a hard cover or binding). It may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths (called a leaflet), or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and saddle stapled at the crease to make a simple book.</p>
                    <p>In order to count as a pamphlet, UNESCO requires a publication (other than a periodical) to have “at least 5 but not more than 48 pages exclusive of the cover pages”; a longer item is a book.</p>

                    <p>RapidSMS is a toolset for rapidly building SMS (text message) services for data collection, streamlining complex workflows, and group coordination using basic mobile phones — and can present information on the internet as soon as it is received.</p>
                    <p>So far RapidSMS has been customized and deployed with diverse functionality: remote health diagnostics, nutrition surveillance, supply chain tracking, registering children in public health campaigns, and community discussion.</p>
                    <p>RapidSMS was designed to be customized for the challenges of governments, multilateral, international- and non-government organizations, and development practitioners: working effectively in spite of geographical remoteness of constituents, limited infrastructure (roads, electricity), and slow data collection (due to paper-based records, slow courier systems, etc). <a href="https://www.rapidsms.org/about/">https://www.rapidsms.org/about/</a>

                    <p>RSS (Rich Site Summary); originally RDF Site Summary; often dubbed Really Simple Syndication, uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated information: blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called “feed”, “web feed”, or “channel”) includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author’s name. RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically. A standard XML file format ensures compatibility with many different machines/programs. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favourite websites or to aggregate data from many sites.</p>
                    <p>Once users subscribe to a website RSS removes the need for them to manually check it. Instead, their browser constantly monitors the site and informs the user of any updates. The browser can also be commanded to automatically download the new data for the user.</p>

                    <p>TED Books are short original electronic books produced by TED Conferences. Like the best TED Talks, they’re personal and provocative, and designed to spread great ideas.</p>
                    <p>TED Books are typically under 20,000 words — long enough to unleash a powerful narrative, but short enough to be read in a single sitting. <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/tedbooks">http://www.ted.com/pages/tedbooks</a>

                    <p>a cookbook as a concept for modular and interchangable publishing by El Bulli</p>
                    <p>“Objects themselves are “effects of stable arrays or networks of relations” (Law 2002, 91) This means that rather than look for an object’s immanent material properties [...] one looks for how this materiality is distinctively expressed in the way an object comes to be situated in unfolding actions. An object may thus be made material by what surrounds and engages it. In particular, it may be materialized by users (and other actors) who define novel ways of relating it to the other entities in their life world. [...] treating objects and specifically technologies as materially consequential but flexibly and nondeterministically.”</p>

            <h2>A Publication taxonomy</h2>
            <p>an Initial Guide to Academic Publishing Types, Inside and Beyond Academe</p>
            <p>The taxonomy covers conventional and digital publishing, as well as emerging hybrid and dynamic forms of publishing.</p>
            <p>Hybrid publishing being media agnostic, crosses over forms of publishing, tackling fundamental changes due to the fallout of digital disruption in areas such as; intellectual property, economics and knowledge institutions etc.</p>
            <p>Dynamic publishing addresses the opportunities of computation and digital networking, where many technologies remain under-explored, hiding in a mnemonic vacuum in new publishing technology development.</p>
            <p>Against this backdrop of institutional and industry forgetting this publication taxonomy is an open invitation to share, negotiate and add–ancient, novel and hybridized forms of knowledge dissemination.</p>

            <p>The taxonomy originates and is maintained on a GitHub repository under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence. There is an open invitation for contributions to the list and the list item descriptions.</p>
            <p>A Publication Taxonomy base URL <a href="https://github.com/consortium/publication-taxonomy">https://github.com/consortium/publication-taxonomy</a>
            </p>
            <p>The full list item descriptions can be found on WikiPedia and have been collected together as a WikiPedia community book. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mrchristian%5CBooks%5CA_Publication_Taxonomy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mrchristian%5CBooks%5CA_Publication_Taxonomy</a>
            </p>
            <p>You are welcome to add to the list of entries and to edit the articles on WikiPedia or on our GitHub repository if the WikiPedia bots or its requirement of a Neutral Point of View (NPOV) proves too infuriating and culturally shallow and you prefer a Critical Point of View (CPOV).</p>
            <p>The issue and necessity of CPOV is outlined in the Institute of Network Cultures’ publication from 2011, ‘Critical Point of View: A Wikipedia Reader’, available online, see <a href="http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/cpov/">http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/cpov/</a>
            </p>
            <p>The Consortium and the Publishing Process</p>
            <p>The collaborative list building project plays a role in the Consortium’s research to understand how boundaries of publishing are shifting. The taxonomy will be used and published in a variety of forms, on an ongoing basis, with the Consortium team acting as list maintainers and editors.</p>
