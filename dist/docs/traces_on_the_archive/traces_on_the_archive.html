<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>A research case study focused on traces on the archive, revealing the hidden journey of a user through an archive, based on the Marshall McLuhan collection at the McLuhan Salon, Canadian Embassy, Berlin. The case study by the Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC), an interdisciplinary research group, investigating the future of publishing and user engagement with the museums, archives and libraries. HPC is dedicated to Open Source software development and enabling crossmedia interoperability.</p>
<p>In the following case study we examine the lengthy video documentation of an insightful lecture by the historian and curator Graham Larkin, held at the Canadian Embassy in Berlin, 2011 and unpack its sections and layers to transform them into a hybrid lecture that allows access to the lecture in revealing and exciting ways. The lecture is a perfect fit for our case study as it uniquely covers Marshall McLuhan's extensive, experimental and avant-garde media practice that usually goes unnoticed next to McLuhan's theoretical oeuvre. It is also a perfect example for tracing a scholar’s personal journey through an archive. In this case Graham Larkin’s journey through the Marshall McLuhan fonds in Library & Archives Canada, Ottawa.</p>

<p>This case study is part of a broader investigation of the HPC concerned with tracing the use of an archive and publishing from archives. In addition to making multimedia content practically available through digital technologies, such as the <i>Hybrid Lecture Player</i>, and across platforms the study also develops concepts that provide a variety of methods and examples of where one can begin accessing an archive.</p>
<p>By traces on the archive we refer to the traces of user activity in the archive, to track the search  and use of artifacts and trains of thought of a user through more elaborate annotation. These traces highlight the hidden parts of an archive, as well as the visitor’s journey through a repository. The idea behind it, is to allow experts, groups and novices to show a pathway through the archive in addition to the work carried out by the formal or official archivist or collection team <a href="#fn2" id="r2">(Archive Manifesto, Hui 2013)</a>. As a result the user can author a pathway through the collection, and we regard these pathways as a new type of publication, as an extra layer on the archive, in the way that users can create layers on OpenStreetMap’s base city maps.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/img/layer-on-the-archive.jpg" alt="an additional layer on the archive" />
<figcaption>Figure: Example for an added layer on a default map. Our additions to the archive can be understood as such, an additional layer on the archive. Taken from: <a href="https://visualisingadvocacy.org/sites/drawingbynumbers.ttc.io/files/35_0.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://visualisingadvocacy.org/sites/drawingbynumbers.ttc.io/files/35_0.jpg</a>. Tactical Tech Collective <a href="https://www.tacticaltech.org/">https://www.tacticaltech.org/</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we look at a variety of ways to make these use-pathways visible and manifest as publishing resources we have two guiding questions:</p>
<ol><li><b>How can a multimedia repository become meaningful to new audiences?</b> How can these traces become maps users in the future and as educational tools for the public programming of an archive? Our point of departure is the conviction that information has to circulate in order to remain within contemporary culture and discourse <a href="#fn1" id="r1">(archive2020, Dekker 2009)</a>. To remain in circulation that also means that content is digitally permeable and malleable, which means involving metadata and collection management tools (the record keeping, indexing and organisation of an archive).</li>
<li><b>What needs to happen in the translation process?</b> This includes translation of; event formats, online migration, or from one medium to another—video documentation to digital transcription—to see how these can be re-utilized in a digital context. What kind of digital publishing strategies and user engagement concepts can be developed to make a visit to an archive worthwhile and sustained? We are looking here particularly at existing strategies of the archive itself, such as for example in the case of the McLuhan Salon the Centennial (2011) event organized by Stephen Kovats and the McLuminations (2011-ongoing) event series by Baruch Gottlieb and Steffi Winkler <a href="#fn7" id="r7">(McLuminations, Winkler, Gottlieb 2014)</a>. For the archive user we examine their role as a newly formed protagonist as ‘user-archivist’.</li></ol>
<p>So far we have developed a few methods and approaches to work with the archive. For example a phased approach to user engagement with the archive. That means moving from social-media bookmarking to creating playlists, up to authoring new content. Another approach is to modularise expert lectures on an archive and make the lecture accessible to the public via the Open Web and open standards. These methods and approaches are outlined in the follow detailed section on the case study.</p>

<h2 id="casestudy">Case Study: Hybrid Lecture Player: Finally getting the Message</h2>
<p>In order to provide a meeting point for researchers, scholars and software developers alike, we hosted an initial workshop at the McLuhan Salon, Canadian Embassy in Berlin, held November 26 in 2014 <a href="#fn6" id="r6">(Traces on McLuhan: http://www.consortium.io/traces-mcluhan>)</a>. The workshop was set up as a rapid prototyping session to establish how to move forward with the concept of an Archive Sprint and publishing from the archive <a href="#fn3" id="r3">(Archive Architectures, Worthington/Zehle/Cornwell/van Mourik Broekman 2015)</a>. Over a full day we collected input and facilitated a discussion from archiving and publishing technologists, McLuhan scholars, and shared our experiences and ambitions for activating archives.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/img/mcluhan_salon_archive_sprint.jpg" alt="Archive Sprint workshop, McLuhan Salon Canadian Embassy, Berlin" />
<figcaption>Figure: Group from the November 2014 Archive Sprint workshop, McLuhan Salon Canadian Embassy, Berlin. <a href="http://www.consortium.io/mcluhan-media-sprint-recap-outlook" rel="nofollow">http://www.consortium.io/mcluhan-media-sprint-recap-outlook</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the workshop it was proposed to work with Graham Larkin’s lecture, a one hour forty-two minute long lecture that was held in 2011 as part of the McLuhan Centennial event organized by Stephen Kovats and hosted at the McLuhan Salon in Berlin. Graham’s lecture drew attention to McLuhan’s extensive and experimental media and publishing practice which is vastly overlooked. Graham accompanied his talk by a set of three hundred and sixty-six slides and hand-picked audio and video footage. The lecture was video recorded. Alas this recording is not able to show the richness of the presentation, missing detail on the slides for example. In short, this documentation has become an artefact but as an educational tool for future scholars it is not so useful.</p>
<p>Therefore the question for us was, if there is a lecture video with valuable insights into an archive how can we reveal the knowledge contained in the video and encourage users to watch it and engage further with the archive?</p>
<p>In our initial assessment we unpacked the lecture, highlighting the valuable elements. We transcribed the lecture and added subtitles to the video using the Open Source platform Amara.org <a href="http://amara.org" rel="nofollow">http://amara.org</a> (a.k.a. Universal Subtitles). We transformed the transcription into a prose text, following a style guide, the Presidential Oral History, <a href="http://millercenter.org/oralhistory/styleguide" rel="nofollow">http://millercenter.org/oralhistory/styleguide</a>.</p>
<p>We re-introduced the topic sections that Graham had used in his talk. Graham provided us with the original slides. These slides were time coded so they could be synched with the video and the text. It is a time-consuming process and it takes a number of contributors but it is easy to learn and execute (transcribe video captions, edit the transcript into prose, timecode the slides and timecode external media/links). Once the time coding was done, the Hybrid Lecture Player software synced the separate parts—video, captions, transcript as prose text, slides and external media/links—using a Github repository. Going through the process to identify a reusable workflow, to document and design it to be as simple as possible is very important in order to make this process a reusable method of enquiry.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/img/time-code-functionality.png" alt="Time code functionality of the Hybrid Lecture Player" />
<figcaption>Figure: Time code functionality of the Hybrid Lecture Player and how it simply combines video, subtitle captions, text, external media and links in a synchronised collection using time codes. All in an easy to author way. See the real thing here: <a href="https://github.com/consortium/traces_on_mcluhan/tree/gh-pages/hybridvideo/data" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/consortium/traces_on_mcluhan/tree/gh-pages/hybridvideo/data</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>We developed a concept of how the lecture media could be formatted and displayed to become a ‘reading environment’ that could be of use to anyone interested in McLuhan’s media practice who has not been at the lecture.</p>
<p>We developed the Hybrid Lecture Player that would combine these components on one browser page. The page has a header with the Hybrid Lecture title, below two menus offering access via sections or via publications. If you do not want to view the lecture from beginning to end you can jump right to a section that you choose. Each section is briefly describe in a window next to the menu. The video is displayed alongside the deck of slides, you can view them as split screen. When playing the video you can watch the slides change on the left in sync with the video on the right. The video itself contains subtitles that can be edited. Currently only in English it will be available in French and German in the near future. Below the slides and the video you will find the transcription window and an additional screen, bottom right, is reserved for external footage such as video clips and supporting background information or links.</p>
<p>The transcription that has been previously transformed/edited into prose text can be synced with  the video and then progresses along with the video—the section that is referred to in the video is highlighted through underline. The viewer has the option to download this text (alongside a selection of slides) as multi-format publication. The conversion that is employed is using A-machine (a modular publishing software ecosystem from the HPC) and Transpect (a multi-format publishing transformation software from the company le-tex).</p>
<p>The footer of the browser contains an about, outlining the case study, further research links related to this case study and the full credits.</p>
<p>The lecture player is developed with Famo.us an Open Source smooth playback render engine for video and browser graphics, ideal for desktop and mobile HTML5 applications.</p>
<p>In this process we have identified a collection management tool set that we plan to connect our prototype to in the near future. This includes freizo from the Data Futures Lab, Tamboti from Heidelberg Research Architecture, as well as video archive management from Pandora. All of the collection managements tools use the established metadata frameworks and controlled vocabularies, e.g. Visual Resources Association (VRA), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) from the US Library of Congress. In addition to collection management we also use a publishing model of the Academic Book of the Future (Archive Architectures, Worthington/Zehle/Cornwell/van Mourik Broekmen 2015) and the Dynabook (A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages, Kay 1972) model of Alan Kay. These two parts are brought together by our multi-format publishing framework A-machine and le-tex software (Please see detailed description in the Window section).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion & Next Steps</h3>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>As researchers and publishing developers we seek to conceptualize strategies that make publishing from archive repositories future savvy. This involves paying close attention to existing and historical forms of user engagement with archival material, and how information is made accessible and relevant to diverse audiences. One of our goals is to facilitate/support the transforming role of the user, from a restricted consumer to an agent, a chief actor—which implies a new understanding of what using an archive means, and a new literacy how to access and work with archival material <a href="#fn5" id="r5">(<i>Free</i>, Rogoff 2010)</a>. Consequential, this means not necessarily serving an institutional model but defining methodologies of one’s own <a href="#fn2">(<i>Archive Manifesto</i>, Hui 2013)</a> and publishing in new ways <a href="#fn9" id="r9">(<i>Traces on the Archive - Dossier</i>, Kral, Worthington, 2015)</a>.</p>
<p>So to come back to our guiding questions. 1) How can a multimedia repository become meaningful to new audiences? 2) What needs to happen in the translation process? We translated the original video documentation of Larkin’s lecture into a multimedia player. This player breaks up the content into smaller bits and adds a signage system to allow the user to enter the documentation at various points. The video was enriched with supporting/additional elements such as original slides, transcription, subtitles, and translations to grant greater comprehension of and insight into the original lecture.</p>
<p>We took the chance to work with this lecture as example of an existing ‘publication’ format of the McLuhan Salon at the Canadian Embassy, Berlin—this proved a good way to analyze what has already been done on the side of the institution to engage users with the archive. And by tracing a user’s journey through the archive (in this case Larkin’s) we practically investigated how this media package could be transformed into a useful educational resource.</p>
<p>This approach is very representational of our understanding of research that engages in a practical form of inquiry. The process usually involves a diverse group of contributors, combines imagination and appropriation with straightforward software development <a href="#fn8" id="r8">(Sommerville 2011)</a> and implementation in real situations/case studies. As a result such a focus places something concrete, but not finished, into the ongoing discourse on the ‘future of publishing’ and allows ideas to permeate, feedback, transform, adapt, integrate and develop further. In fact, every finalized case study yields at the next steps that have to be taken in our research.  </p>
<h4 id="next">Next Steps</h4>
<p>In this case, the next steps will be to connect the demo of the Hybrid Lecture Player to collection management and digital publishing. The current demo has been built as a stand alone Web presentation, but our ambition is to connect it to archive management software allowing for easier authoring by users, further enabling the user to move from consumer to become an author of a hybrid lecture her/himself. Below is our roadmap for the project.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/img/roadmap.png" alt="Trace on the Archive roadmap" />
<figcaption>Figure: Trace on the Archive roadmap. Moving from stand alone Web presentation publishing demo to connected archive publishing Open Source framework.</figcaption></figure>
<ol><li><b>Hybrid Lecture Player Demo Release - </b>the initial demo is to act as a testing prototype for reflection and further design to work on; interfaces, how to augment media and technical implementations for mobile, web, tablet and print publishing.</li>
<li><b>Hybrid Lecture Player - Open Source Release - </b> the Open Source release allows to test two parts of the framework. a) How to design the framework as a minimal setup for someone to add shorter video work. b) To gauge the ease of use for an editor to create their own publication which involves editing the time code files to sync; text, video and external links.</li>
<li><b>Multi-format Publishing - </b>release the Hybrid Lecture Player as a software framework and as module of the larger A-machine publishing ecosystem. Produce prototype research publication for the development of processes, methods and case studies. An emphasis on the Hybrid Publishing Consortium’s model of—interoperability, standards, design methods and working with existing Open Source expert projects.</li>
<li><b>McLuminations 2011 - </b>an accompanying publication by Steffi Winkler and Baruch Gottlieb covering the 2011 McLuminations series. This demo publication would focus on the eBook format and the Transpect multi-format publishing software workflow.</li>
<li><b>Archive Digitization - </b>full archive collection management and compatibility with the A-machine structured data multi-format publishing framework. This includes examples such as; Heidelberg Research Architecture tools, including Tamboti, Pandora and Scanning; Data Futures’ Freizo software for asset management. All of the above in VRA/MODS US Library of Congress metadata compliant standards and using controlled vocabularies.</li>
<li><b>Collaborative Publishing Layers - </b>Traces on the Archive publishing tool kit combines two closely related models of publishing Archive Architectures and the Dynabook. Some practical examples of publishing functionality are; A. Social media bookmarking B. Playlists C. Authoring new content. D. The scholars note book and archive tracer. This also envisages case studies of ‘publishing from the archive’ in the Open Education Resources (OER) sector.</li></ol>

<h3>Hybrid Publishing Consortium</h3>
<p>At the Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC) we pursue a model of digital interoperability, frameworks as opposed to platforms, that combines ISO standards with experimental approaches to dynamic publishing <a href="#fn4" id="r4">(A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages, Kay 1972)</a>, combining existing Open Source expert projects. Around these Open Source projects we engineer a software ecosystem, called A-Machine, that allows us to create numerous solutions connecting different software modules for a variety given publishing workflow situations.</p>
<p>A-Machine can be briefly described as HPC’s software ecology that provides publishers with the latest Open Source multi-format workflows. Its research involves three research tracks;</p>
<ol><li>Examining publishing workflow and identifying Open Source projects to support these varied workflows;</li>
<li>Building software for multi-format transformation based on a ‘single source’ architectures;</li>
<li>Promoting an 'application framework' and API model to allow interoperability between Open Source providers.</li></ol>
<p>These three tracks feed into the umbrella theme of 'Designing the Book of the Future', which encapsulates our research ambitions to enhance the technology of Moveable Type. The HPC research on the development of A-machine is carried out by running four case studies, each focusing on different aspects of digital publishing development.</p>
<p>This involves collection management, hybrid media annotation, automatization, markup standards, single-source publication conversion in multiple output formats etc. We are determined to keep this concept modular so it can flexibly grow and accommodate different needs, types of publishing projects and be scaleable. The work on this lecture tool is the beginning for a further investigation of how to make Open Source lecture tools, such as Matterhorn, Edex etc., better and suit different audiences.</p>

<p>Avco’s recent software development has been focused on experimental data interfaces. In celebration of John Cage’s centennial (2014) celebrations Aldeburgh Music and arts organisation The Space commissioned Avco to develop the ‘Musicircus’ app (<a href="http://musicircus.thespace.org/?nocols=3%26hud=1" rel="nofollow">http://musicircus.thespace.org/?nocols=3%26hud=1</a>) - an online experience of a John Cage inspired happening at Aldeburgh, the home of Benjamin Britten, on the Suffolk coast, England.</p>
<p>In 2009 Avco created the 'Music Map’ (<a href="http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/musicmap" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/musicmap</a>) for the avant-garde NMC music publisher to promote their catalog of artists. In 2015 Avco will be creating a new version, using open source javascript libraries and open standards to ensure the map's future viability.</p>
<p>Avco was established in 1997 by Daniel Jackson and Tina Spear.</p>

<figcaption>Figure: Heidelberg Research Architecture (HRA) portal, with links to major collections, guides and Open Source tools. Example collections include; Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, Global Politics on Screen and Video Annotation Database</figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the umbrella of the Heidelberg Research Architecture (HRA), Heidelberg University, Germany, IT scientists, software developers, database architects, academically trained professionals in e-learning as well as IT support staff collaborate with researchers and students at the Cluster for Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context“ to form an integrated digital humanities environment for interdisciplinary and internationally distributed studies of transcultural dynamics.</p>
<p>The HRA's agenda thus covers the entire range from developing sophisticated metadata frameworks for making transcultural relations traceable and analyzable across diverse media types (texts, images, films, audio) and disparate objects (texts, concepts, social networks) to offering IT support for the Karl Jaspers Centre, Heidelberg University.</p>

<figcaption>Figure: Tamboti interface for meta description editing and collection management. Such tools are needed to create machine readable and exact records for scholarly research. Tamboti has been created through experiences of managing over ninety world class collections at Heidelberg University, Germany</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tamboti is an application for working with metadata based on the MODS, VRA and Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard.</p>
<p>MODS is a standard used to catalogue books, articles and other traditional library material, and visual or online material such as images, videos, web sites or other sources.</p>
<p>Tamboti is similar to the public interface of the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) of the library systems used by national and university libraries. Tamboti can process a large amount of records.</p>
<p>In Tamboti, you can annotate records with metadata concerning language, script and transcription. This function is important for records used in multilingual contexts.</p>
<p>Tamboti is based on the eXist Native XML database. As eXist itself, Tamboti is Open Source and free. The eXist database system can be installed with a standard application installer.</p>
<h3>Transpect, le-tex</h3>

<figcaption>Figure: example transpect document transformation workflow, in this case showing a Docx transformation to InDesign</figcaption></figure>
<p>As the company’s name implies, le-tex has a background in mathematical typesetting with TeX. Since its inception in 1999, le-tex has been active in the field of structured information, particularly SGML, XML, and HTML, with a focus on modeling, converting, checking, and rendering scholarly content. Since 2008, le-tex has been developing conversion tools for XML-based file formats on the basis of the XSLT 2.0 programming language, a W3C standard. The XML-based file formats include OOXML (.docx), IDML (InDesign), and EPUB. In 2012, le-tex published its conversion &amp; checking libraries and their configuration methodology as a software framework, called <b>Transpect</b>, under a BSD Open Source license. In addition to being Open Source, <b>Transpect</b> employs only standardized technologies – namely XSLT 2.0, which is orchestrated into more complex workflows by XProc scripts – XProc also being a W3C standard.</p>
<p>HPC has been working with le-tex and has a public repository where the Transpect software can be installed from here <a href="https://github.com/consortium/BinB" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/consortium/BinB</a></p>
